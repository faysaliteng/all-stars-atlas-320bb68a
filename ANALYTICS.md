## 🏗 Architecture Evolution

### Phase 1: Static SPA (v1.0–v1.7)
- Pure React frontend with mock data
- localStorage-based CMS
- No real API integration
- shadcn/ui component library with Tailwind CSS
- Dark/light theme system

### Phase 2: API Integration (v1.8–v2.2)
- Real backend with Express + MySQL
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens (15min access + 7-day refresh)
- SMS (BulkSMSBD) + Email (Resend) notification system — 10 triggers
- Social login (Google GSI + Facebook SDK v19.0)
- Zero-mock enforcement — all mock data removed from codebase
- DataLoader component with skeleton/error/retry states

### Phase 3: GDS Integration (v2.5–v3.9.7)
- TTI/ZENITH for Air Astra domestic flights (WCF SOAP-like)
- BDFare for Bangladesh carrier aggregation (REST API v2)
- FlyHub for 450+ airline access (REST API)
- Sabre REST for international flights (BFM v5, OAuth v3)
- Sabre SOAP for real-time seat maps (EnhancedSeatMapRQ v6) + ancillaries (GetAncillaryOffersRQ v3)
- Multi-provider parallel search with `Promise.allSettled` + deduplication
- Real PNR creation, ticketing, and cancellation across all providers

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features (v3.5–v3.9.7)
- 4-step mandatory booking flow with SSR injection (16 meal codes, wheelchair, medical, UMNR, pets, FF#, DOCA, OSI)
- Passport OCR with MRZ validation (ICAO 9303 check digits)
- QR/Barcode cross-validation with confidence scoring
- Branded fares from Sabre (Economy Light/Smart with per-brand policies)
- Auto-ticketing on payment confirmation (SSLCommerz/bKash/Nagad → GDS ticket issue)
- Reward points system (earn 1% + redeem as coupons)
- Interactive aircraft-aware seat maps (narrowbody 3-3, widebody 3-3-3, ATR 2-2)
