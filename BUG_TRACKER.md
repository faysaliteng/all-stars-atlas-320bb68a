## 🔍 Recurring Patterns

### Pattern 1: Schema Mismatch
- Sabre REST API schema is strict — any extra/wrong field causes 400
- **Lesson**: Always validate payload against Sabre's published schema before sending
- **Occurrences**: C01, C04, C05

### Pattern 2: Response Format Changes
- GDS providers update response formats without notice
- **Lesson**: Add defensive parsing with multiple format fallbacks
- **Occurrences**: C06, C08, M02

### Pattern 3: Cache Staleness
- Cached tokens/configs expire but cache doesn't self-invalidate
- **Lesson**: Always add retry-with-fresh-cache logic for auth tokens
- **Occurrences**: C02, C07

### Pattern 4: Mock Data Leakage
- Placeholder/hardcoded data persisting in production code
- **Lesson**: Zero-mock policy — search entire codebase for hardcoded values
- **Occurrences**: M06, M07, M09, U08, U12

## 🛡 Prevention Measures Adopted

| Measure | Implemented In |
|---------|---------------|
| Zero-mock enforcement | v3.0+ — no hardcoded flight/hotel data |
| Schema-safe payload builders | v3.9.3+ — `toSabreDateTime()`, full DOCS |
| DOCS strict mode | v3.9.9.7 — no fallback without passport data |
| Smart field detection | v3.9.9.7 — file path vs passport number |
| Retry-with-fresh-session | v3.9.7 — SOAP seat map |
| Priority chain extraction | v3.9.6 — TTI airline PNR |
| Dual PNR extraction | v3.9.9.7 — CreatePNR + GetBooking |
| Dedup key comprehensive | v3.7.8 — all legs included |
| `safeJsonParse()` utility | v2.1 — prevents JSON.parse crashes |
| Centralized validators | v3.5.1 — `isScopeInvalidRoute()` |
